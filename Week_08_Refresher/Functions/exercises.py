# 1. Write a Python function to find the maximum of three numbers.
# Sample Numbers: 3, 6, -5
# Expected Output: 6


# 2. Write a Python function to sum all the numbers in a list.
# Sample List: [8, 2, 3, 0, 7]
# Expected Output: 20


# 3. Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list.
# Sample List: [8, 2, 3, -1, 7]
# Expected Output : -336


# 4. Write a Python program to reverse a string.
# Sample String : "1234abcd"
# Expected Output : "dcba4321"


# 5. Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number (a non-negative integer). The function accepts the number as an argument.
# Sample Input: 5
# Expected Output: 120


# 6. Write a Python function to check whether a number falls within the range [3,9).
# Sample Input: 5
# Expected Output: 5 is in the range


# 7. Write a Python function that accepts a string and counts the number of upper and lower case letters.
# Sample String: 'The quick Brow Fox'
# Expected Output:
# - No. of Upper case characters : 3
# - No. of Lower case Characters : 12


# 8. Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with distinct elements from the first list.
# Sample List: [1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
# Expected Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


# 9. Write a Python function that takes a number as a parameter and checks whether the number is prime or not.
# Note : A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 and that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
# Sample Input: 187
# Expected Output: False


# 10. Write a Python program to print the even numbers from a given list.
# Sample List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# Expected Output : [2, 4, 6, 8]


# 11. Write a Python function to check whether a number is "Perfect" or not.
# According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself).
# Sample Input: 6
# Expected Output: True


# 12. Write a Python function that checks whether a passed string is a palindrome or not.
# Note: A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.
# Sample Input: "madam"
# Expected Output: True


# 13. Write a Python function to check whether a string is a pangram or not.
# Note: Pangrams are words or sentences containing every letter of the alphabet at least once.
# Sample Input: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
# Expected Output: True


# 14. Write a Python function that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of words as input and returns the words in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
# Sample Input : green-red-yellow-black-white
# Expected Result : black-green-red-white-yellow


# 16. Write a Python function to create and print a list where the values are the squares of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included).


# 17. Define a Python function which takes unlimted parameters as input and returns the result of the first number subtracted by all other numbers
# Sample Input: 10, 1, 2, 3
# Expected Output: 4
